- **I extract multiple decision-relevant insights from the same data and adapt analyses to different stakeholders.**

- **Concrete example**
- Same raw retail data, different stories tailored to product, marketing, and revenue stakeholders.

| Stakeholder | Question                      | Your skill            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Marketing   | Who should we retain?         | Customer segmentation |
| Product     | Why are returns high?         | Return rate analysis  |
| Revenue     | What price maximizes revenue? | Pricing optimization  |
| Leadership  | What should we prioritize?    | Impact synthesis      |
